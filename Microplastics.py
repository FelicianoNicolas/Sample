    ### Did you know?
    When plastic bottles break down, they turn into tiny pieces called **Microplastics**.
    
    👀 **They are invisible!** smaller than a grain of sand.
    🥤 **They are everywhere!** In the ocean, in rivers, and even in tea bags!
    🐟 **Fish eat them** by mistake, and that makes them sick.

    Scientists found a way to use **WOOD SAWDUST** to clean water!
    
    ### How does it work? 🧪
    1. **Take Sawdust:** Like the dust from a pencil sharpener.
    2. **Add Plant Juice (Tannic Acid):** This is found in grapes and tea. 🍇
    3. **Mix it up:** The plant juice acts like **GLUE**.
    
    ✨ **THE MAGIC:** The mixture acts like **sticky velcro**. It grabs the microplastics and holds them tight, but lets the clean water flow through!
